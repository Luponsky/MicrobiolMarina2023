# [RTutor](http://rtutor.ai/)   
### RTutor uses OpenAI's powerful large language models to translate natural language into R code, which is then excuted. You can request your analysis, just like asking a real person. Upload a data file (CSV, TSV/tab-delimited text files, and Excel) and just analyze it in plain English. Your results can be downloaded as an HTML report in minutes! Very Good for Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
